# Installing Git

In order for you to be able to use Git on your local machine, you would need to install it.

In this interactive training we will install git with the following command:

```
sudo apt install git-all
```{{execute}}

Once you have installed Git, in order to check the version of Git that you have installed on your machine, you could use the following command:

```
git --version
```{{execute}}

Example output:

```
git version 2.25.1
```{{execute}}

In my case, I have Git 2.25.1 installed on my laptop.
