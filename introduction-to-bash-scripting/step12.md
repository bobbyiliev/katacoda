In order to debug your bash scripts, you can use `-x` when executing your scripts:

```
bash -x ./for-loop.sh
```{{execute}}

Or you can add `set -x` before the specific line that you want to debug, `set -x` enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal.


Another way to test your scripts is to use this amazing tool here:
