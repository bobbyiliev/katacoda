As with any other programming language, you can use variables in bash as well. However, there are no data types and a variable in bash can container numbers and characters.

To assign a value to a variable all you need to do is use the `=` sign:

```
name="DevDojo"
```{{execute}}

> Note: as an important note, you can not have spaces before and after the `=` sign.

After that to access the variable, you have to use the `$` and reference it like this:

```
echo $name
```{{execute}}

Wrapping the variable name between curly brackets is not required but is considered good practice:

```
echo ${name}
```{{execute}}

The above would output: `DevDojo` as this is the value of our variable.

Next, let's update our `devdojo.sh` script and include a variable.

Again, with your favorite text editor open the file:

```
nano devdojo.sh
```{{execute}}

And update the file so it looks like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

name="DevDojo"

echo "Hi there $name"
```{{copy}}

**Save** it and run it again:

```
./devdojo.sh
```{{execute}}

You would see the following output on your screen:

```
Hi there DevDojo
```

Here is a rundown of the script:

* `#!/bin/bash` - first we specified our shebang
* `name=DevDojo` - then we specified a variable called `name` and assigned a value to it
* `echo "Hi there $name" - finally we output the content of the variable on the screen by using `echo`
